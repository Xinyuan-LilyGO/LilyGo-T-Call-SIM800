## FAQ

### 1. If you are unable to download, please try the following steps, if it still does not work, please contact customer service

1. Open the serial monitor
2. Short IO0 to GND
3. Press the RESET button on the board, if the serial port communication is normal, then you should see

    ```bash
    ets Jun 8 2016 00:22:57

    rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x3 (DOWNLOAD_BOOT(UART0/UART1/SDIO_REI_REO_V2))
    waiting for download
    ```

4. If you can see the above message, it means that the communication is normal, then all you need is to let it enter the waiting download mode, then you can click upload, usually it can solve the problem of not being able to download automatically

### 2. About the 5V power pin description on the board

   - For IP5306 power supply, the 5V power pin connected to the USB board is the output, and the voltage is boosted by IP5306 power supply chip.  According to the manual, its maximum output current is 2.4a.  Do not connect USB, can 5V input.
   - When using AXP192 power supply, the 5V power pin on the board is the input, and it is connected with USB 5V+. There is no other power output on the board except for the 3.3V output.

### 3. Didnâ€™t connect to the Internet for a long time, or just turned off suddenly?

   - It may be due to insufficient USB power supply current, please connect a lithium battery to the board, then plug in the USB and test again.


### 4. Why doesnâ€™t the board turn on when the lithium battery is connected?

   - If you use the **IP5306** version and use a lithium battery to supply power, you must press the reset button to turn on the board. 
   - If you use the **AXP192** power management chip, you need to press and hold the PWR button for 2 seconds to turn on the power supply. By default, the AXP192 will be powered on when the battery is inserted. 


### 5. About SIM800X built-in firmware update

   - SIM800 built-in firmware update tool Because SIMCOM has not adapted and updated the new system for a long time, it is not necessarily available to upgrade the built-in firmware tool. Most users are stuck waiting for download. Please be informed
   - [How to update firmware](doc/How%20to%20update%20firmware.md)

### 6. LED indicators

- Blue LED, controlled by GPIO13
- Red LED, network status light
